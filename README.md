# MLOps Mini Projects

Welcome to the MLOps Mini Projects repository! This collection of mini-projects showcases various aspects of MLOps, including deploying Machine Learning models, Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, Deep Learning projects, and orchestrating CI/CD/CT pipelines. Each project is designed to demonstrate best MLOps practices and provide practical insights into the deployment and management of machine learning applications.

## Projects

1. [**Deploy Machine Learning Projects**](https://github.com/Praveen76/Deploy-ML-Projects-tutorial)
   - Deploy a machine learning model using utilizing Titanic Data, and incorporating Data-preprocessing, Model Training, Model Deployment, etc.

2. [**Deploy Loan Approval Classifier Model on Azure Cloud**](https://github.com/Praveen76/Deploy-Loan-Approval-Classifier-on-Azure-cloud)
   - Create an end-to-end MLOps pipeline on Azure Cloud for Loan Approval Classifier Model, incorporating pre-processing, model training, and deployment.**

Feel free to contribute by adding your own mini-projects to the list!
