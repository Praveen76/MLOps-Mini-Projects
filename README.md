# MLOps Mini Projects

Welcome to the MLOps Mini Projects repository! This collection of mini-projects showcases various aspects of MLOps, including deploying Machine Learning models, Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, Deep Learning projects, and orchestrating CI/CD/CT pipelines. Each project is designed to demonstrate best MLOps practices and provide practical insights into the deployment and management of machine learning applications.

## Projects

1. [Build and deploy an advanced IBM Watson AI chatbot using Flask](https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-and-deploy-an-advanced-IBM-Watson-AI-chatbot-using-Flask) : Build an advanced chatbot, utilizing IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery service, Rest APIs to fetch data, Flask, etc.
2. [Build CI Pipeline for ML Models using Docker and GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-CI-pipeline-for-ML-models-using-Docker-and-GitHub-Actions): This repository contains code and files for building and deploying a Machine Learning model for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using FastAPI, Docker and GitHub Actions.
3. [**Deploy Loan Approval Classifier Model on Azure Cloud**](https://github.com/Praveen76/Deploy-Loan-Approval-Classifier-on-Azure-cloud): Create an end-to-end MLOps pipeline on Azure Cloud for Loan Approval Classifier Model, incorporating pre-processing, model training, and deployment.

Feel free to contribute by adding your own mini-projects to the list!
