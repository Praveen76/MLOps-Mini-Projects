# MLOps Mini Projects

Welcome to the MLOps Mini Projects repository! This collection of mini-projects showcases various aspects of MLOps, including deploying Machine Learning models, Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, Deep Learning projects, and orchestrating CI/CD/CT pipelines. Each project is designed to demonstrate best MLOps practices and provide practical insights into the deployment and management of machine learning applications.
